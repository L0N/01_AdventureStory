## Requirements
### Week 1 HTML challenge
Now I would like you to have a go at the following challenge. We are going to draw together all of the elements that you have learned so far today. The aim of this challenge is to create a choose your own adventure game, using HTML. There are a few stipulations for this which will be outlined below. The idea is that the user will hit the home page, and then be able to follow different paths through the ‘game’ depending on which links they choose. You can spend some time coming up with a theme and a story, but this is not the emphasis of this challenge (although if you are having fun, please go ahead and make it interesting).
If you need a reference for this idea, think of old choose-your-own-adventure books, or ancient games like Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
**You must fulfill the following requirements:**
- A home page to start the game off, with an image to indicate that this page is the home page, and a little bit of context about the the game the user is about to play.
- The home page much use at least 5 different tags, and have at least 4 layers of nesting. Ask me if the idea of nesting is unclear.
- The game must have at least 12 different pages that can be navigated to. You can keep these simple, but if you have time you should make them more complex.
- Each page must have an image that gives some indication of what page they have arrived at. (You can also have an image for the page you are heading to as well.)
- Each page must have a list, and both (main) types of list must be used in the project (ul and ol).
- At least five of the images must be from the local system, and should be stored in a folder within the project (and the rest can be linked from the internet).
- If you have finished, please investigate some more about semantic HTML, and choose at least 4 more elements from these options to incorporate into your project.
- If everything is working as it should, please go back and tidy up the code as much as possible. Indentation is vitally important in HTML, and also to keep the code consistent (when you make a choice, stick with it). 
- Image resizing
You may need to resize your images, and we haven’t done any CSS yet. 
Here is an example to get you through for now:
<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">
This will help you get the images under control. There is a resource below that you can use, but we don't want to get too caught up in CSS. Might just be handy to size the images slightly.

Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is an educational video game released by Broderbund in 1985. It is the first product in the Carmen Sandiego franchise. The game was distributed with The World Almanac and Book of Facts, published by Pharos Books. An enhanced version of the game was released in 1989, which did not have the almanac-based copy protection and instead used disk-based copy protection. A deluxe version was released in 1992, and featured additional animation and a reworked interface from the original version. Some of the bonus features included digitized photos from National Geographic, over 3200 clues, music from the Smithsonian/Folkways Recordings, 20 villains, 60 countries… Show more (32 kB)
